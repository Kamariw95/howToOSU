NOTE: At this point in the debate, its to the point where most major market programs are on both platforms. With the exception of a couple programs, theres not much missing from either side.
Comes down to specs/price on the individual machine.
Mac - Better suit for design (graphic design majors), based off of linux (for Computer Science majors) - lacks access to some coding platforms.. but for the most part is viable. Can have Windows on it if need be.
More suitable for the “arts” (Music, Design, etc)
Windows - Most used platform. Has access to all major market tools. If CSE, has a lot of the major market text editors. Familiarity.
