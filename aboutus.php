      <h4> About Us: </h4>
      <h5>
        As students of The Ohio State University, we understand the idea of being a bit nervous or anxious about entering college,
        especially one the size of Ohio State.  We come from in-state, out-of-state, and even out of the country.  Even with our various
        backgrounds, we all agreed that there was a lot of information we did not know prior to starting school at Ohio State.  We
        thought to ourselves- how could we help incoming students be better prepared for college?  And how can we help them maintain
        themselves after being settled in?  We hope this site takes the edge of new students as well as providing a source for older
        students when they need help.</h5>
