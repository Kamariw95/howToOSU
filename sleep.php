  How much sleep should I be getting? About 7-8 hours (although it varies from one person to another).
  Why is sleep important?  It restores energy, fights off illness & fatigue (strengthens immune system), helps us think and focus, allows better memory, creates more positive mood, reduces likelyness to become stressed, reduces possibility to form mental health issues, and more.

  	What happens when I don’t get enough sleep?  You’re more likely to come down with an illness, feel stressed or anxious, feel depressed, gain weight, decrease your academic performance.

  How can I get a better sleep? 1. Avoid caffeine/food a few hours before sleeping
  2. Maintain regular bed/wake times
  3. Do something that helps you “unwind” before bed (i.e. a bath, listening to music, reading a book)
  4. Create an environment conducive to sleeping (dark, quiet, comfortable)
  5. Don’t do work in bed
  6. Avoid pulling all nighters
  7. Take a short nap during the day
