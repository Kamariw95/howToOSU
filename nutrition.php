  How do I maintain a healthy diet?
  Eat breakfast- even if it’s on the go!
  Drink water- at least 8 cups a day. Also, keep a water bottle handy!
  Keep healthy snacks with you- temptation for junk food will decrease when you don’t have any with you.
  Eat fruits and vegetables- take a visit to the salad bar!
  Drink alcohol in moderation- and avoid high calorie, sugary drinks if possible.
  Don’t skip meals
  Learn what a proper portion is- to avoid overeating.
  Eat your food slowly

  How do I know “how much” I’m eating?
    If you’re eating from dining halls at Ohio State, check out http://diningservices.osu.edu/NetNutrition/1 for nutrition facts.
    If you’re eating store bought food, check out the labels.

  College women should be eating approximately 1,800-2,400 calories per day, while college men should be eating approximately 2,400-3,000 calories per day depending on height, weight, and activity level.
