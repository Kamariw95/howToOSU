  <h5>How do I maintain a healthy diet?</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Eat breakfast- even if it&#39;s on the go!</li>
    <li>Drink water- at least 8 cups a day. Also, keep a water bottle handy!</li>

    <li>Eat fruits and vegetables- take a visit to the salad bar!</li>
    <li>Drink alcohol in moderation- and avoid high calorie, sugary drinks if possible.</li>

    <li>Learn what a proper portion is- to avoid overeating.</li>

  </ol>
