  <h4> Printing: On and Off Campus! </h4>
  <br />
  <p> Printing is one of the biggest things on campus, but it is the least talked about. While it is good to have a printer on campus, it&#39;s not the end all be all if you don&#39;t! Here&#39;s why.</p>

  <h5> Printing on Campus </h5>

  <div class="content">
    <ul class="collapsible popout" data-collapsible="accordion">
      <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">filter_drama</i>By Major</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>  Typically, depending on the major, you are allotted a certain number of pages to be able to
          print in the building of the College you are in. For example, as a Computer Science major I can print up to 500 pages for free in Dreese.
          All you have to do is be able to log in onto computers in the college, and you are good to go.</p></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">place</i>Libraries</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><p> In various libraries around the campus, they have printers. In the 18th Avenue Library on the first
            floor, there are printers available. To print, you must log on to one of the computers on the floor and use the BuckID Cash as a form of payment. Pages usually cost .10/page, which isn&#39;t bad when you need something printed at the
            last minute. The same goes for Thompson and Orton libraries.</p></div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <h5>Printing in Residence Halls</h5>

      <p>You&#39;re able to print in residence halls, if that is a sufficient option for you. Printers work as long as the printer is connected via USB to the computer you&#39;re printing from, rather than via Wireless. </p>

      <p>Apparently, if your major does not require a lot of printed works, you do not need to buy a printer at home. However, if your teacher requires a lot of homework in hardcopy, which is printed, you had better buy a printer.</p>
